      Hi, I'm Sagar Giri!ðŸ‘‹ <br />
      Iâ€™m a final-year Computer Engineering student at IOE, Pulchowk Campus, and
      currently a Research Intern at NAAMII (Nepal Applied Mathematics and
      Informatics Institute for Research). My work mainly focuses on medical
      imaging and multimodality learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond that, Iâ€™m deeply interested in agentic AI and the advancement of AI
      and data technologies. Currently, Iâ€™m working on low-resource language
      transliteration. I also have experience in OCR, document parsing,
      generative AI, and building chatbots using RAG and fine-tuned LLMs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of academics and research, I enjoy cooking. I love experimenting
      with flavors and trying out new recipes from different cuisines.
