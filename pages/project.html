      >
      <p class="project-desc">
        This is a multi-modality classification solution for the BraTS 2025
        Pathology Classification challenge , which achieved 5th place globally
        in the competition . Our approach combines image and text modalities
        using cross attention to classify pathological images into 10 distinct
        classes.

        >HandWritten Document Recognition and Grader:
      </span>
      <p class="project-desc">
        This project utilizes a YOLO model to segment words from documents,
        which are then processed by a CRNN-based model to convert handwritten
        text into digital text. The model was trained on the IAM dataset,
        achieving a Character Error Rate (CER) of 0.11. Additionally, the system
        was adapted for automated grading of handwritten student assignments
        using a fine-tuned BERT model.

      <p class="project-desc">
        Developed a system for extracting structured data from Nepali documents
        using OpenCV for image preprocessing, OCR models (Tesseract), and a
        fine-tuned BERT NER model, achieving accurate extraction of 13 custom
        tags with JSON output formatting.

      <p class="project-desc">
        Developed a model for the Patternverse competition to generate
        variations of a given carpet image in terms of color and pattern.
        Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion ControlNet using LoRA on 5,000 images
        provided by Alternative Technology Company. Integrated CLIP embeddings
        for prompt-based customization, achieving an inference time of 5 seconds
        per variation.
